  "text": "The goal of this documentation is to comprehensively explain the Node.js API, both from a reference as well as a conceptual point of view.  Each section describes a built-in module or high-level concept.\n\nWhere appropriate, property types, method arguments, and the arguments provided to event handlers are detailed in a list underneath the topic heading.\n\nEvery .html document has a corresponding .json document presenting the same information in a structured manner.  This feature is experimental, and added for the benefit of IDEs and other utilities that wish to do programmatic things with the documentation.\n\nEvery .html and .json file is generated based on the corresponding\n\n.markdown file in the doc/api/ folder in node's source tree.  The documentation is generated using the tools/doc/generate.js program. The HTML template is located at doc/template.html.\n\nThroughout the documentation, you will see indications of a section's stability.  The Node.js API is still somewhat changing, and as it matures, certain parts are more reliable than others.  Some are so proven, and so relied upon, that they are unlikely to ever change at all.  Others are brand new and experimental, or known to be hazardous and in the process of being redesigned.\n\nThe stability indices are as follows:\n\nStability: 0 - Deprecated\n\nThis feature is known to be problematic, and changes are\n\nplanned.  Do not rely on it.  Use of the feature may cause warnings.  Backwards\n\ncompatibility should not be expected.Stability: 1 - Experimental\n\nThis feature was introduced recently, and may change\n\nor be removed in future versions.  Please try it out and provide feedback.\n\nIf it addresses a use-case that is important to you, tell the node core team.Stability: 2 - Unstable\n\nThe API is in the process of settling, but has not yet had\n\nsufficient real-world testing to be considered stable. Backwards-compatibility\n\nwill be maintained if reasonable.Stability: 3 - Stable\n\nThe API has proven satisfactory, but cleanup in the underlying\n\ncode may cause minor changes.  Backwards-compatibility is guaranteed.Stability: 4 - API Frozen\n\nThis API has been tested extensively in production and is\n\nunlikely to ever have to change.Stability: 5 - Locked\n\nUnless serious bugs are found, this code will not ever\n\nchange.  Please do not suggest changes in this area; they will be refused.\n\nStability: 1 - Experimental\n\nEvery HTML file in the markdown has a corresponding JSON file with the same data.\n\nThis feature is new as of node v0.6.12.  It is experimental.",
